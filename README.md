# Morse decoder

The project's idea is very simple, the Arduino program has the responsibility to upload the sensor's data to the USB serial port. From there I used plain old C++ to  read the signal (in Unix, everything is a file) and stores in the the application. Oringally, this and plotting the data were my only targets. But since the signal/noise ratio was so good, I saw it suitable for transporting information and that is where Morse code comes in. The setup worked out quite well and here is the result of me demonstrating to decoding the message generated by an Android app.

### Setup

The light dependent transistor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor) is a passive component that decreases resistance with respect to receiving luminosity (light) on the component's sensitive surface. Arduino gave me a really nice tool to start with this component, the bread board setup is really easy, too.

With some standard component and a bit tutorial of https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/sumanbargavr/working-with-light-dependent-resistor-ldr-1ded4f and we are ready to go.
