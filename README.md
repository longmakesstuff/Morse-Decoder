# Morse decoder

Hello world. As my journey of learning C++ continues, I deceided to play around a bit with hardware programming, which can be done pretty easily with an Arduino Kit.

The project's idea is very simple, I wrote a small Arduino program to upload the light dependent voltage to the USB port. From there I used good old C++ to process, interpret and plot the data. After looking at the data for a while, I found the signal very clean and therefore suitable for transporting information.
